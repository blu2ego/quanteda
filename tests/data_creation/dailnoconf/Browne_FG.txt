At present, the public image of politicians is not good. I am a full-time politician. I have no business or other interest from which I earn money. My only income derives from being a full-time politician in this House. I have no hang-up about declaring my interest in any new document the Government may bring on stream and I am sure most other politicians feel the same. Indeed, if the truth were known about most full-time politicians in this House, the bank managers would be the people to declare the interest on our behalf because of the situation in which we find ourselves from year to year, and particularly from election to election.

We have heard much about elections in the last three days. Everyone on the far side seems to want an election. I have never seen as many smiles on the faces of politicians as I did this morning when the word came out that the Progressive Democrats and the Fianna Fáil Party were about to come to an arrangement and were to continue in Government. If all politicians were honest, they would admit to being happy that there was not to be a general election.

The allegations and the financial scandals in Greencore and Telecom of the past four to six weeks are not normal in this country. The truth needs to be established and the public informed of that truth. I hope the investigation committees, which are now in being, will establish the truth so that we will know who are the guilty people. I am very concerned about Greencore because of the massive amounts of profit made by individuals or by groups of individuals within that company. There is a need to get to the bottom of this allegation, to establish the truth and to have that truth made known to the general public. If there has been wrongdoing and it can be proved, then these people should face the full rigours of the law. As a Fianna Fáil politician I have no hang-up about people being brought to justice. I hold no brief for such people and I would be only too glad, when the inquiry report back on Greencore and Telecom and the truth is established, if action is taken.

As Deputy Davern said, all business people should not be tarnished with the one brush. The majority of business people are decent hard working people who make an honest living and provide jobs. It is important that those people who are providing a service should be recognised and that we would not tarnish the good name of business people in Ireland because of what happened to a minority.

We need business people to invest and create jobs. Unfortunately, during the past six weeks the real problems of unemployment have been sidelined on all sides of the House, including this side. There must be serious concern about our high unemployment problems. Too many of our young people are unemployed and too many of them have to leave Ireland. In some housing estates, including some in my constituency 75 per cent or 80 per cent of the working population are unemployed. This is a national scandal. It is important, regardless of our political persuasions, that we put our heads together and try to resolve our unemployment problems. It is not good enough for politicians to continue to pay lip service to our escalating unemployment problem. We must have concrete proposals to deal with these unemployment problems.

I hope the Programme for Government agreed today between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats - which includes very positive ideas and actions to deal with unemployment - will be pursued and that we will get the full support of the political parties on all sides to resolve the serious problems that exist.

We have other problems in Ireland at present. Agriculture is going through a difficult time and there are problems in housing and with the economy generally. Some of the allegations made in this House are not doing politicians any good. The sincerely held view of all Members is that some of the allegations made here over the last three days are an absolute disgrace and have done much damage to politicians generally. In the real world the people are cynical of politicians today.  They see this House as a cosy little arrangement making large amounts of money, being well-paid and looking after ourselves, but in many instances that is not the case. Most politicians - regardless of which party they represent - are decent hard working people and represent their constituents to the best of their ability.

During the past six to eight weeks the media have been very unfair to politicians. They have presumed by innuendo, allegation and by half-truths that politicians are all gangsters, that we are in it for what we can get out of it and that we are making massive amounts of money from big business. As we are all aware a certain amount of the allegations, innuendo and half-truths will stick and will affect us all in the long term. The media must have some sense of national responsibility. They are part of Irish society and should think carefully about the damage they are doing to some of the business concerns and business people who are working within the law and providing jobs. I am not saying all media people are guilty but, over the last six to eight weeks the majority have not come out of this situation with glory.

Today, we are discussing a motion of confidence and I have no doubt the Government will survive, that we will continue to provide good Government and that we will continue to improve the economy for our people.

Many of the red herrings introduced by the Opposition during the last three days will be seen by the general public for what they are nothing more than political propaganda to try to embarrass the Fianna Fáil side of this Government. I say they have wasted their  time and the public will continue to support this Fianna Fáil-led Government for the next two and a half years.
