We are having this confidence debate because the Government have undermined confidence in the political system and confidence in our institutions. They have undermined the confidence of the Irish people in themselves. The Government, by producing a fraudulent budget in 1991, laid the foundation for the undermining of the national finances. This Government in the way they negotiated the Programme for Economic and Social Progress knowingly made commitments that the State could not afford. They deceived people. They undermined the trust on which good industrial relations is based. This Government, by forcing spending Estimates through without examination and all in one vote last July, undermined the constitutional role of Dáil Éireann.

This Government, sleepwalking through a world-wide economic recession, have presided over the highest level of unemployment and emigration in the history of the State. This Government, in their culture of clever deals and clientelist politics, have lowered standards and contaminated other parts of our society. This Government have abandoned the agricultural community to their fate in Europe, without tabling any alternative to the MacSharry proposals. This Government have allowed the housing problem to grow to the point that we now have 30,000 families in bad housing  conditions waiting to be housed. That is the legacy after their four years in office.

This Government have become profoundly unpopular, not because of recent scandals but because those scandals have awakened people to the fact that their Government react to events rather than seek to shape them. The Government reacted to the scandals with a spate of partial investigations but they did not prevent the scandals in the first place through proper ministerial supervision of Government bodies. They reacted with surprise and bafflement to the dramatic growth in unemployment this year, with a spate of task forces but never had and do not now have any coherent employment strategy for next year, the year after or the rest of the century.

They reacted with a series of ill-considered radio interviews to the fact that their 1991 budget, predictably, went off the rails. They followed this instant reaction with inconclusive discussions with the social partners. It is clear now, despite all we have heard, that the Government's entire budgetary strategy has collapsed and they have nothing to put in its place. The 1992 budget is looming, bills must be met but the Government have not begun to consider how they will be met. That is a measure of the Government's loss of a sense of coherence and direction.

As Northern Ireland moves deeper and deeper into sectarian conflict with one murder following another, the Irish Government just sit and occasionally react to the latest move by the British Secretary of State, but they have no policy of their own, and have not had one for the past four years. Neither do they appear to care very much one way or another.

And, probably worst of all in its long-term seriousness, this Government again react helplessly to the latest proposals from others on the shape of the new Europe, on the Common Agricultural Policy, and on the latest proposal on European defence. Again, they have no policy of their own on any of these matters. They have not produced an Irish  White Paper on how the new federal Europe should be structured. They are drifting into European defence commitments, with no concept of why they are doing so, apart from a vague and pathetic wish not to be seen to be left out of the club. That is about the depth of the Government's consideration of European issues.

In the real sense of the word, Ireland does not now have a Government. We have Ministers, we have an impressive Government office, much more impressive than four years ago, we have black cars going to official openings, but we do not have anybody planning the nation's future, or at least for more than 48 hours ahead.

Perhaps the most expressive photograph in 1991 of "Mr. Haughey's Ireland," to use the title of a television programme, is that of people, middleaged as well as young, queuing up in Dublin's historic GPO to post off applications for Morrison visas, to get out of here as quickly as possible to the recession-ridden United States. That is the extent of their confidence in "Mr. Haughey's Ireland" after four years of Fianna Fáil.

Even the much touted successes of the earlier years are now seen to have been superficial. The large growth rate of the 1987-88 period is now revealed by students of economics to have been little more than the release of pent-up consumer savings. A large part of the budgetary economies of 1987-89 came from simply postponing pay commitments to the then distant "future". That future has now arrived, the bills must now be paid, and the so-called achievements of earlier years are seen in their true context, postponements, of problems. A large part of the other budgetary economies of that time were also achieved through postponements, postponements of hospital buildings, postponements of school buildings and postponements of house building. All will have to be built eventually but most assuredly by a different Government.

Indeed the most notable feature of the  1987-89 period was the Tallaght Strategy wherein, for the first time in the nation's history, the main Opposition party offered constructive co-operation to a minority Government in the national interest. It says much about the core values of Fianna Fáil that they rejected this new approach in a petulant fashion at the earliest possible opportunity. It also says a great deal about the core values of the Progressive Democrats now absent from the House that they spent those two years doing their very best to sabotage the Tallaght Strategy.

At least the two parties now in Government have that much in common. Neither party in the period 1987 to 1989 had any appreciation of the national interest. Indeed, both parties deservedly lost seats in the subsequent general election. Neither of them have any real regard for the national interest at the present time, otherwise they would not be carrying on the destabilising charade that we have witnessed during the past 13 weeks.

Throughout the past four years there has been virtually no structural reform of the economy, of our institutions or of public spending. Despite promises, there has been no local government reform. Our system is still centralised and our elected councillors have been reduced to being little more then temporary unpaid public relations officers for permanent officialdom.

There has been no reform of the public service. There has been no public service reform Bill, as the Government led by Deputy FitzGerald had planned. There is no reward for exceptional services performed by permanent officials. There is no delegation of formal responsibility to named officials. There is just the continuance of the old system under which all power theoretically resides in the Minister's office, and nothing gets done.

Nor has there been any overall reform of the health service in the past four years. It is still an illness service. It is still hospital centred. It is still over-administered and under-managed. The present Taoiseach still does not hear the message that so much took him by surprise in the  middle of the 1989 general election. He could see no crisis in the health service then, just as he could see no jobs crisis earlier this year.

There has been no fundamental educational reform. After four years the Minister for Education is still talking about producing discussion documents. We have had no Education Act, no educational accountability, no educational targets, no comparisons with other countries and no statutory body set up to set and examine the curriculum. After four years the system is still driven by written exams alone. Children are still dropping out of school too early. Access to third level education is still grossly unfair - unfair to those of limited means, and unfair in particular to those whose parents are in the PAYE sector. There is no money to put this right, we are told, but there is money - nearly £10 million - to take Carysfort College off the hands of a friend.

There has been talk of tax reform - enough talk to make people unsure about the future, unsure, in particular, about the future of mortgage interest relief, and thus reluctant, perhaps, to invest in a home. But there has not been much actual tax reform. In a country with a huge shortage of work we tax work in such a way as to make sure that we have even less of it than we had previously. Ireland's tax system, in a country with record levels of unemployment is, quite simply, perverse.

The entire structure of our rural life is about to be devastated. Thousands of PAYE jobs in the food industry are to be destroyed by the MacSharry proposals, without any mention from Commissioner MacSharry of compensation for those PAYE people who lose their jobs. However, this Irish Government have no policy or plan for the future of Irish agriculture, no more than they have tabled any alternative proposals to those put forward by Commissioner MacSharry. They are willing to sit and agree meekly with those proposals, apart from making a few public relations gestures for domestic consumption. Indeed, as all of that happens the same Government  are allowing our food industry's remaining good name to be destroyed by intervention scandals, by angel dust and by the failure to eradicate bovine TB.

Meanwhile, however, in Government Buildings it is party politics as usual - Chinese politics, it seems. The Progressive Democrats are like Mao Tse-Tung. He believed in perpetual revolution. They believe in perpetual renegotiation. They cannot make up their minds whether they are part of the Government. They have two voices - one for the Cabinet Room and another for the public gallery. As for the Taoiseach, he sees himself as some sort of ancient Chinese leader who goes on and on and on and on - a depressing self-obsession.

I shall not refer to the content of the Taoiseach's rather foolish speech made in the House today, beyond saying that he made many references to and innuendoes about people who could not defend themselves and then made a reference to a person who is not here in the House, did not elaborate the charge he was making and did not have the grace to withdraw the charge when he was challenged. That says a lot about the extent to which the Taoiseach has thought through what he is doing in this House. I suppose the most charitable thing that could be said about the Taoiseach's speech is that it was in its content and its delivery indicative of the desperate position in which he finds himself.

But let me turn to more fundamental issues. The recent spate of scandals arose precisely because we do not have a proper system of accountable parliamentary democracy in Dáil Éireann. If the Dáil had proper powers of scrutiny, and if the Government and State bodies had felt themselves to be genuinely accountable to the House on an ongoing basis in the past four years, then none of those scandals would ever have happened. It is because the Dáil has not been reformed, because the Dáil does not have the means to call Ministers and State bodies to account before decisions are taken that there has been this depressing and damaging succession of scandals.  The source of the problem lies ultimately in the unreformed nature of this House.

Last July £6 billion of taxpayers' money was approved here, at the Government's request and with the agreement of other parties, in a single Vote, without a single item of spending being scrutinised. That done, this Government then sent the entire House off on holidays for three months. If that is the way this House treats the approval of the spending of £6 billion, is it any wonder that State companies have acquired a rather light-hearted way of dealing with the expenditure of a mere £1 million or £2 million? The problem starts here in this House. Neither Ministers nor permanent officials are ever asked to come before a committee of this House to explain before they spend taxpayers' money why they propose to spend it in a particular way. There is no parliament in Europe where that would be the case except this one. As elected representatives we are uniquely irresponsible. That is why we continue to have scandals. That is why this party are determined to take office in this country in order to reform Dáil Éireann and our political system. Until that happens we will have the risk continuing of a recurrence of the sort of situation that has done so much damage in this country over the last two months. Of course in this House we are great, and indeed this Government are particularly good, at ordering inquiries and looking for papers after the harm has been done, when the money is already misspent. That would not be necessary if the Dáil had been allowed do its job properly in the first place. Again, because Ministers themselves are not held accountable here in this House, in turn they do not feel any need to hold State boards responsible for accounting to them until it is too late. That is the price we pay for not having a proper working committee system here in Dáil Éireann.

Facing an exploding jobs crisis earlier this year Fine Gael, a party of 55 Deputies, formally proposed the establishment of an all-party forum on jobs,  indeed a call that was supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. It is a measure of the contempt in which this Taoiseach holds the Dáil and its Members that he did not even have the manners to reply to that offer from the second largest party in the House in the face of a jobs crisis of historic proportions.

Next year the Irish people will vote in a referendum to approve a fundamental change in the constitution of the European Community. That is what it is behind all the gobbledegook about Inter-Governmental Conferences; it is a new constitution for a new Europe. Much of this has been agreed already behind closed doors. Yet no one in this House, this sovereign Assembly, has been allowed to examine, let alone debate, any of the many drafts of this new European Treaty. This House has not been allowed - and will not be allowed as long as this Government remain in office - to make any contribution towards getting the best deal possible for Ireland. Yet the final treaty is to be settled in Maastricht - again behind closed doors - no more than seven weeks from now. The pattern is the same as with all the other issues to which I have just referred. Because this House is not holding the Government to account over their policy on Europe, the Government do not actually need to have a policy and this Government do not have any policy as far as this new development in Europe is concerned. As a result - I say this carefully in the hope that all in this House will listen - we may well be heading for a national disaster in the referendum on the new European Constitution next year. If that happens it will be because Dáil Éireann was not involved in the process and public opinion was not prepared for what the public will be asked to agree next year.

Of course, this lack of accountability suits the Taoiseach's very personal style of government - nothing on paper; no Cabinet minutes; just a quite telephone call, radio interview or, more often, the knowing glare and the job is done; no trace left behind. The muck sticks to other people, disposable people. And the people around him, the 77 Fianna Fáil  Deputies, are prepared to go on putting up with this. Well, the Irish people are not prepared to put up with it any longer. That is the message from this House and from my party in this debate; it is time to go.

Why did NCB get all those consultancies without open tender, including one from the Department of Energy? Why was UCD asked to buy Carysfort, not when it was available at a low price, but later on when it was almost £2 million dearer and when nobody else wanted to buy it? Why did that happen? Why can State board chairmen be sacked on radio without a Cabinet meeting to discuss whether that should happen? The answer to all three questions is quite simple. Under the present Taoiseach Ireland does not have accountable Cabinet Government. We have personal Government. In the final analysis it will be the fault of every one of us here in Dáil Éireann, including the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil backbenches, if that continues for much longer. Indeed, in every sense, public life is now dominated by what I would describe as the culture of the deal - a quiet deal to take the Johnston Mooney and O'Brien site off Mr. Desmond's hands; a quiet deal to ensure that Mr. Desmond's "Sail Ireland" got a large amount of public sponsorship from Government companies already deeply in debt, a quiet deal with the social partners about matters that are the proper responsibility of elected representatives in this House. And now, it is hoped, a quiet deal, or perhaps not such a quiet deal, with Deputy Desmond O'Malley, Minister for Industry and Commerce.

It seems to me now that it is not just the detail that is wrong as far as this Government are concerned; it is the whole culture. As Eastern Europe opens up long-shut cupboards to the rigours of parliamentary democracy and to open market competition we here, at the very western extreme of Europe, are setting out in the opposite direction to keep our  elected Parliament in the dark about all-important matters, to take business decisions, not on the basis of competitive efficiency but rather on the basis - to use the famous phrase in the recently published letter - of "political contacts". We are going in precisely the opposite direction, in so far as opening up our society, to that which the newly democratised countries of Eastern Europe are travelling.

Of course in this debate we will be told there are investigations under way and that we should not prejudge them. I prejudge nothing. I speak simply on the basis of the facts that are already known and uncontested. On the basis of those facts I assert that this Government are rotten to the core and should go. In any event, the investigations they now propose are only partial and inadequate investigations of some, but not all, of the allegations. For example, the Telecom inquiry does not specifically include the Findlater House building or the Merrion Road building. The Telecom inspector does not have the power of access to bank accounts. Without access to bank accounts, to the "money trail", so to speak, one cannot actually find out, in modern commercial arrangements, who is really benefiting from any particular deal. In this surreal world of Cypriot companies, of mysterious shareholders and interlocking transactions the truth is whatever the man who is paying one's bill says it is. The inspectors appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce have not been given the power to go behind that and follow bank accounts as they must if they are to get to the truth.

Of course - and the Taoiseach made a few references to me during this debate about an allegation I made - the allegation I made, one which has been entirely substantiated by Aer Lingus, in respect of the leak of Aer Lingus information to Celtic Helicopters, is not being investigated either. There is no need to investigate it; the case is proven. Neither is there an investigation into the amazing decision subsequently to appoint Mr. Dermot Desmond Chairman of Aer Rianta despite the fact that the Tánaiste,  and other Ministers, knew what had happened. Nor indeed is there any investigation into the circumstances in which the Minister for the Environment instructed Dublin County Council to initiate a special pipeline across the Taoiseach's land. Not only do these investigations not cover these important matters, and thus are ridiculously limited, but the Government's other proposals in response to these scandals have been entirely unconvincing. There was no mention of a serious fraud office until after Fine Gael had called for it. There was no mention of chairmen "stepping aside" until after Fine Gael had called for that also; even the precise words used were borrowed. There was no mention of an ethics code until Fine Gael and other Opposition parties had called for that. Significantly, the hastily proposed ethics code is to apply to State boards, but not to Ministers. I wonder why.

There are many Members who are fearful of a general election. There are people outside this House who profess themselves worried about what they describe as "instability". Let me ask those people a serious question. What, in all seriousness, could be more unstable than the attempted continuance of this Government for another two years? No decisions will be taken, planning will stop. Those who want no change in any area are always talking about "instability". This is the most unstable Government this country could possibly have at this juncture in our national history.

Any Government who could spend 13 weeks debating whether they could continue or not and then only make up their minds after a confidence debate has started are profoundly unstable. If a political scientist wants to find an example of a government which is inherently unstable, then this Government represent that example. This is not the first time. Throughout the past two years there has been a recurring series of "high noons" and last minute stand-offs. This has created continuing instability and it will continue with ever greater intensity, no matter what is agreed or not agreed  today, tomorrow or next week, for as long as this Government lasts. In today's case this stand-off has actually led to substantial outflows of funds because of the instability and uncertainty created by the fact that the Government cannot make up their minds whether to stay together or not. These outflows of money can be documented. It is costing this country money and much of this money will never come back. If this Government continue in office, this sort of thing will go on happening month after month. It is not good for the country. The Progressive Democrats are not serving either their party's or their nation's interests by keeping the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, in power. They know that and their supporters know it.

As long as this Government continue, survival will be the sole guiding principle. The entire drama will be about one individual, not about the needs and aspirations of 3.5 million people who want to feel that this is their country and that it is a country to be proud of. That is something they do not feel today.

A Cheann Comhairle, I should like to say to Deputy Haughey directly, you and your associates, by staying on in office, are stifling the regeneration of this country; you are a barrier on the road; you are a reminder of past vanities, a hangover from an earlier era, it is time for you to go.

If Members want to form an alternative Government they can and will do it. That is what the Irish people want them to do. Of course smaller parties may protest that they would like someone else to do the job. They might suggest that someone else should put Fianna Fáil back into office after the next election. Supporters of all the parties in this House, apart from supporters of Fianna Fáil, do not want to see Fianna Fáil back in office after the next election with the support of anybody. I can confidently assert that there will be no party in this House who will wish to see Fianna Fáil back in office after the next election. Whatever honest differences there are among the parties, there will be no party in this House who will collaborate in putting Fianna Fáil  back into office after what we have seen in the past two years. The Progressive Democrats will not do it. The Workers' Party will not do it and the Independents will not do it. The Labour Party will not do it and the Fine Gael Party will not do it. Our supporters do not want to see Fianna Fáil back in office and they will not let us put them back in office.

We will put in place a Government who will not be led by Fianna Fáil. That is what the people now want and that is necessarily and inevitably what they will get. That Government will restore the faith of Irish people in themselves. It will tackle long-ignored social problems in our community, including the problem of marriage breakdown. That Government will tackle Ireland's endemic unemployment problem with a coherent set of measures and will be committed to sound fiscal policies which are the inevitable necessity for membership of a single European currency area. They will be a Government who will reform the Dáil and give everybody's representative, including the Opposition Fianna Fáil Deputies, a chance to do a constructive job.

The Fine Gael Party are ready and willing to take up this challenge whenever it arises. We have the confidence to know that we can do the job and we will do it immeasurably better than the present Government. We will restore stability to public life. Above all we will restore to the Irish people sufficient sense of pride in their country that they will want to live and work here.
